                <h3>History</h3>
                <p id="history">Kenville has a population that is ethnically diverse: roughly equal portions of Indian and Darkie residents,
                     with smaller Coloured ('Brainos') and White communities.
                    English is the most common first language in the area, followed by isiZulu and isiXhosa and a bit of seSotho - reflecting the suburb's multicultural character.
                    This diversity shapes local shops, places of worship, schools and community life.
                    Kenville contains a mix of formal residential properties (standalone houses and apartment complexes) 
                    and areas of informal housing (settlements or ‚Äúthe ghetto/the projects‚Äù communities).
                     The suburb and its immediate surroundings include mosques and Hindu temples serving local communities,
                      small commercial strips, and older residential roads that reflect Durban‚Äôs layered urban development.
                    The heart of Kenville is right by the CBD (Kenville's CBD) which is found on Bongani's Street or Bongani's Avenue.
                     The CBD connects most of the Kenville sections/areas, which are Jamaica Section,
                      Ethempeli Section and the main road continues till it reaches
                      the Siyathuthuka, Eringini, and Johanna Road sections.</p>

                <h3>Recent Events</h3>
                <p>In recent years Kenville has received media attention because of fires and the vulnerability of informal settlements
                     in the area.
                     Several devastating shack fires have displaced hundreds of residents;
                      these incidents prompted emergency relief and rebuilding efforts involving municipal and provincial agencies.
                     Local infrastructure projects (for example road works) and community safety concerns have also
                      been part of ongoing local political discussions. 
                     NGOs and municipal programmes have at times targeted Kenville and neighboring
                      Sea Cow Lake for upgrading and slum-improvement work.</p>
